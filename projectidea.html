	<p/>We are planning to build a mobile app similar to what we proposed in our initial proposal. We want to design an app that helps you build your shopping lists each week at the grocery store. Many times we go to the store and forget to buy one thing, or we want to make a new recipe but donâ€™t remember to buy all of the ingredients. Our app will focus on helping users build lists of foods that they buy frequently, and allow users to choose recipes they want to make that week and automatically add the ingredients to their list. Over time the app should be able to better predict what items you want to buy each week, and will ideally save users time in making their lists and preventing them from making extra trips to the store.<p>
